# Travelling_Breathers
This folder contains video animations for travelling breathers in 1D discrete strongly nonlinear locally resonant metamaterials.
File (mode_shapes_kr_0_04_I0_03_withlogo.avi) shows the travelling breathers in the low k_r zone. The results indicate the out-of-phase motion between the local resonator and the holding cell. Parameters used in this simulation: k_r=0.04, I_0=0.3.
File (mode_shapes_kr_1_I0_03_withlogo.avi) shows the travelling breathers in the low k_r zone. The results indicate the in-phase motion between the local resonator and the holding cell. Parameters used in this simulation: k_r=1, I_0=0.3.
